# Brownian-Motion
Summary: Simulation of brownian motion utilizing 2D, perfectly elastic collision dynamics.

Detailed: 
This program models a physical phenomena known as brownian motion. Brownian motion is a process that governs diffusion processes. The kinetics of water molecules, for example, create a movement pattern that appears random. This phenomena was discovered in 1827 by Robert Brown after observing the random movement fluctuations of a pollen grain in water. This is what this program aims to simulate. To accomplish this, a physics engine was created. Specifically, perfectly elastic collision dynamics were modeled in 2D.
